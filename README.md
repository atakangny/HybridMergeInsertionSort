# Hybrid Merge-Insertion Sort

Hybrid Merge-Insertion Sort: This algorithm combines the Merge Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms to achieve better performance.

The algorithm first uses Insertion Sort to sort small subarrays of the input array.

Then, it uses Merge Sort to recursively sort larger subarrays.

When the size of a subarray falls below a certain threshold, the algorithm switches to Insertion Sort. 
This threshold can be adjusted based on the characteristics of the input data to optimize performance.

The Hybrid Merge-Insertion Sort algorithm has several benefits. 
It takes advantage of the efficiency of Insertion Sort for small subarrays and the scalability of 
Merge Sort for larger subarrays. This combination can result in a faster overall running time compared 
to either algorithm on its own.

However, it's worth noting that the performance of any sorting algorithm depends on various factors 
such as the size and distribution of the input data, memory constraints, and available hardware resources. 
Therefore, it's important to benchmark and test any new algorithm before using it in production to ensure 
that it provides the expected performance gains.
